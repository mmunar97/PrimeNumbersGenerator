# PrimeNumbersGenerator

This library contains the C ++ functions that determine whether a number is prime or not. The implemented methods can be classified into two categories:

- Exact methods: They allow to determine with exactitude if a number is prime or not. Eratosthenes sieve and Wilson's test have been implemented.
- Probabilistic methods: They have a random polynomial execution time, so they have a probability of error. Fermat, Miller-Rabin and Solovay-Strassen tests have been implemented.
